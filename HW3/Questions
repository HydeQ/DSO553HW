2 questions - 10 points each

Question 1
Input Data:
db.orders.insertMany( [
{ _id: 0, productName: "Steel beam", status: "new", quantity: 10 },
{ _id: 1, productName: "Steel beam", status: "urgent", quantity: 20 },
{ _id: 2, productName: "Steel beam", status: "urgent", quantity: 30 },
{ _id: 3, productName: "Iron rod", status: "new", quantity: 15 },
{ _id: 4, productName: "Iron rod", status: "urgent", quantity: 50 },
{ _id: 5, productName: "Iron rod", status: "urgent", quantity: 10 }
] )
(you may have to delete all the double quotes and redo it again)
Output needed:
a)
[
{ _id: 'Iron rod', sumQuantity: 75 },
{ _id: 'Steel beam', sumQuantity: 60 }
]
b)
[
{ _id: 'Iron rod', sumQuantity: 60 },
{ _id: 'Steel beam', sumQuantity: 50 }
]
c)
[
{ _id: [ 'Iron rod', 'new' ], sumQuantity: 15 },
{ _id: [ 'Iron rod', 'urgent' ], sumQuantity: 60 },
{ _id: [ 'Steel beam', 'new' ], sumQuantity: 10 },
{ _id: [ 'Steel beam', 'urgent' ], sumQuantity: 50 }
]
d)
[
{ _id: [ 'Iron rod', 'urgent' ], sumQuantity: 60 },
{ _id: [ 'Iron rod', 'new' ], sumQuantity: 15 },
{ _id: [ 'Steel beam', 'urgent' ], sumQuantity: 50 }
]
Please do the aggregation function for each of the steps above. And for each of the answers
identify how many stages are there in the pipeline.
